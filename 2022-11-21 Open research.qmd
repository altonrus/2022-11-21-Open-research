## Agenda

-   **Overview**

-   My workflow

-   Example

Follow along

-   Github repository <https://github.com/altonrus/2022-11-21-Open-research>

-   Slides in web browser <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/altonrus/2022-11-21-Open-research/blob/main/2022-11-21%20Open%20research.html#/title-slide>

## Reproducible

Can be exactly redone, given same materials

-   Code

-   Environment

-   Data[^1]

[^1]: Adapted from [Telling Stories with Data by Rohan Alexander](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/04-workflow.html)

## Reproducible for whom?

-   Can **you** run your entire workflow again?

-   Can **another person** run your entire workflow again?

-   Can **"future-you"** run your entire workflow again?

-   Can **"future-another-person"** run your entire workflow again?[^2]

## Paradigm shift

Manuscript is an advertisement

"Product" is:

-   Code

-   Data

-   Shiny tool

-   etc.

## Why people don't share code?

-   Didn't have to

-   It's not 'clean enough'

-   Want to keep competitive edge

-   Mistakes might be found

## Why people don't share code?

-   Didn't have to

-   It's not 'clean enough'

-   Want to keep competitive edge

-   Mistakes might be found

Usually, not good reasons

## Why should we share code?

-   Fully communicate methods

-   Research as a public good

-   More potential contribution

-   Mistakes might be found

-   Can increase citations

**Messy code \>\>\> No code!**

## "Data available on request"

Gabelica et. al.[^3] found:

[^3]: Gabelica, Bojčić, and Puljakc 2022. *Journal of Clinical Epidemiology* 2022. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2022.05.019>

-   3416 of 3556 articles (96%) included data availability statements

-   1782 (42%) indicated data available on request, **but**

    -   1528 (86%) did not respond

    -   131 (7%) declined to share

    -   123 (7%) shared their data

## Can't share data due to privacy?

Code is very useful even without data

-   Helps communicate your methods

-   Others can adapt + run on their own data

Increase reproducibility without sharing data with

-   'Data dictionary' in supplement

-   Synthetic data

## Environment

-   R and packages updated all the time

-   No guarantees of backwards compatibility

-   Potential solutions

    -   [renv package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) for **r**eproducible **env**ironments

    -   Docker containers

## R projects

-   Self contained set of files (data, scripts, reports)

-   Portable **if** all file paths relative to project directory

    -   Bad:`"\Users\alton\projects\COVID\data\dat.csv"`

    -   Bad: `setwd("\Users\alton\projects\COVID")`

    -   Good: `"1_data\dat_file.csv"`

## Each script should run error-free in new session

Use console when designing code, but 'restart r and clear output' for 'production.

Change global options to maximize reproducibility

## Literate programming

Idea of Donald Knuth: Code snippets and 'natural language' (English) interspersed in one document

-   **Jupyter notebooks** Python, Julia

-   **RMarkdown** R, Python with some extra steps

-   **Quarto documents** R, Python, Julia

    -   You're looking at one

## Agenda

-   Overview

-   **My workflow**

-   Example

## R project organization

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](figs/generic-project-directory.png){width="399"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   **1_data** (self-explanatory)

-   **2_scripts** code not embedded in manuscript

-   **3_intermediate** intermediate outputs

-   **4_output** figures, tables that will be read into the manuscript

-   **5_manuscipt** .Rmd or .qmd manuscript
:::
:::

## .gitignore

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](figs/gitignore-example.png)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
Any folder or file you don't want on github

-   "local" folder for data use agreements, conference presentations, etc.

-   "private" folders for objects that cannot be made public

I keep Github repos private at first, but they become public when I publish.

**If sensitive data were ever in repo, hard to remove!**
:::
:::

## **Git**hub in RStudio

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
![](figs/github-in-rstudio.png)
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
-   Can pull, commit, and push within Rstudio

-   Use terminal for more complex things

-   Also works in Rstudio server!
:::
:::

## RMarkdown/Quarto documents

-   Quarto will eventually replace RMarkdown

-   Some RMarkdown packages don't work in Quarto

-   "Knit" (RMarkdown) or "Render" (Quarto) to:

    -   HTML (this document)

    -   PDF

    -   Word

    -   Powerpoint

## Literate programming (.Rmd or .Qmd)

### Code chunks

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

library(ggplot2)
fread("1_data/data.csv")
```

### Inline code

## My Manuscript template

-   .Rmd that knits to Microsoft Word

    -   Collaborators can track changes
    -   Some medical journals still prefer Word

-   Requires a .bib file for bibliography

    -   Can make with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or Mendeley

-   Use [flextable package](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/reference/index.html) to make pretty tables

## Manuscript template .Rmd

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](figs/manuscript-template-head.png)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   YAML header to specify title, output format, bib file, citation style

-   `<br>` for line breaks; `#####` for page breaks

-   Can use latex for equations
:::
:::

## Manuscript folder contents

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](figs/manuscript-folder-contents.png)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   **Reference manuscript:** set format for headers, table of content, etc.

-   **.csl file** specifies citation format (AMA format with numbers in brackets)

-   **.bib file** contains references to cite by citation code, e.g., `[@russell2021a]`
:::
:::

## Screenshot of "knit" manuscript

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](figs/manuscript-knit-to-word.png)
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
-   Normal word document

-   Collaborators track changes and return

-   I manually update .Rmd (annoying)
:::
:::

## Citations: Zotero → Bibtex → .Rmd

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](figs/zotero-screenshots.png)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Export Zotero collection to Bibtex in same folder as .Rmd

-   To replace default CiteKey, add `Citation Key: <CiteKey>` to 'extra' field

-   In .Rmd header, set `bibliography: [filename].bib`

-   Cite with `[@CiteKey]` or `[@CiteKey1; @CiteKey2]`

## Zenodo repository

<https://zenodo.org/>
